ðŸ’¡ __NB__: A match is won when a player has won the majority of the prescribed number of sets [(best-of-five)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format#Best-of-five_playoff) in this kata.
  A __best-of-five__ is a head-to-head competition between two teams, wherein one must win three games to win the series.
  Three is chosen as it constituted a majority of games played. 
  If one team wins the series before reaching game 5, all others are ignored.
 
  
   1.  The game starts with a score of 0 point for each player
   2.  Each time a player wins a point, the Game score changes as follow: 0 -> 15 -> 30 -> 40-> Win game.
   3.  If the 2 players reach the score 40, the DEUCE rule is activated.
   4.  If the score is DEUCE , the player who  win the point take the ADVANTAGE.
   5.  If the player who has the ADVANTAGE win the  point, he wins the game.
   6.  If the player who has the ADVANTAGE loses the point, the score is DEUCE.
   7.  The set starts with a score of 0 Game for each player.
   8.  Each time a player wins a Game (see SPRINT 1), the Set score changes as follow: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 (-> 7)
   9.  If a player reaches the Set score of 6 and the other player has a Set score of 4 or lower, the player win the Set.
   10. If a player wins a Game and reach the Set score of 6 and the other player has a Set score of 5, a new Game must be played and the      first player who reach the score of 7 wins the set.
   11. If the 2 players reach the score of 6 Games, the Tie-Break rule is activated.
   12. Each time a player wins a point, the score changes as follow 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 (-> 8-> 9-> 10-> â€¦)
